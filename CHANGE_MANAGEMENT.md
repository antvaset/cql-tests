# Overview
## **What is the Digital Quality Implementer's Community?**
DQIC (pronounced "D-Quick") is a meritocratic, consensus-based community project focused on Digital Quality measures. Anyone with interest in the project can participate as a Stakeholder and a Contributor. Participation in these processes is completely voluntary. This document describes how that participation takes place and how to set about earning merit within the project community. 


Although these processes are adapted from the [OSSWatch Meritocratic Model](http://oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/meritocraticgovernancemodel), this documentation is a formalization of existing processes involving relevant stakeholders.

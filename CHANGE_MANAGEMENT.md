# Overview
This is a meritocratic, consensus-based community project. Anyone with interest in the project can join the community, contribute to the project design and participate in the decision making process. Participation in these processes is completely voluntary. This document describes how that participation takes place and how to set about earning merit within the project community.

Although these processes are adapted from the [OSSWatch Meritocratic Model](http://oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/meritocraticgovernancemodel), this documentation is a formalization of existing processes involving relevant stakeholders.

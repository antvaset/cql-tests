# Overview
## **What is the Digital Quality Implementer's Community?**
DQIC (pronounced "D-Quick") is a meritocratic, consensus-based community project focused on Digital Quality measures. Anyone with interest in the project can participate as a Stakeholder and a Contributor. Participation in these processes is completely voluntary. This document describes how that participation takes place and how to set about earning merit within the project community. 

## **Who can be part of DQIC?**
Any interested stakeholder that is involved in digital quality measurements is welcome; however, participation as a committer or DQIC Steering Comittee (DSC) member requires active participation and contributions as Committers and DSC members, compliance with the DQIC charter, and a monthly membership fee. Contact DQICâ€™s Executive Committee (https://www.ncqa.org/digital-quality-implementers-community/) to learn more about official membership in DQIC . All products produced by DQIC will be open-source and available to the public.
Although these processes are adapted from the [OSSWatch Meritocratic Model](http://oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/meritocraticgovernancemodel), this documentation is a formalization of existing processes involving relevant stakeholders.

#Roles
